# WebScrapeIntroduction
This was a simple introduciton project for me. I want to get into data analytics, and I figured a good start was to web scrape data. I learned about the BeautifulSoup library, and used it along with other research to scrape a table off of Wikipedia and transition it to a csv file. Was fun, and I look forward to enhancing my skills in this area.
